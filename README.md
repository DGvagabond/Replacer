# Replacer
Replace players that disconnect from the game with a random spectator. At the moment, the only config option is for enabling/disabling the plugin itself. Should this plugin not only work as intended, but also end up used by many; I'll see to making the plugin much more configurable.
This is largely based upon DCRplace by Cyanox62 with the port over to Exiled 2.0.5 essentially made by thomasjosif's Ultimate AFK plugin.
